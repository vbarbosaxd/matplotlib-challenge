# Matplotlib Challenge

## Project Overview
For this project, I was tasked with analyzing the data of a study performed by an anti-cancer pharmaceuticals company called Pymaceuticals. The purpose of the study was to see if their drug, Capomulin, performed better than other drugs at decreasing skin cancer tumor growth in mice over a period of 45 days.

## Analyses Performed
* Summary statistics (which included mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM) of each drug tested
* Bar graph using Pandas and another using Matplotlib showing the total number of timepoints for each drug
* Pie graph using Pandas and another using Matplotlib showing the sex distribution of the mice used
* Finding the quartiles and outliers of final tumor volume for the drugs Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, and creating a box plot with the results
* Making a line plot with the data gathered from a random mouse given Capomulin to visualize results
* Creating a scatter plot of average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for Capomulin
* Calculating the correlation coefficient and linear regression model for the Capomulin scatter plot

## Programs Used
* Matplotlib library
* Pandas library
* Jupyter Lab
